## Test account

**Sign in with Apple** is the only auth method.

For the reviewer's convenience we provide a demo Apple ID pre-seeded with sample data:

- **Apple ID:** [FILL IN — e.g., kalta.review@icloud.com]
- **Password:** [FILL IN]
- Two-factor authentication: [FILL IN method — code via text, trusted device, etc.]

*(If you prefer to use your own Apple ID, that also works. The app accepts any Apple ID.)*

After signing in, the demo account has:

- 2 sample warehouses ("Basement pantry", "Garage supplies").
- Boxes with items at various expiration states (expired, soon, OK, no-date).
- A membership in a shared warehouse to demonstrate multi-user behavior.

## Feature walkthrough

A full review can be done in ~3 minutes:

1. **Launch app** → Sign in with Apple (demo account above).
2. **Dashboard** — see warehouses sorted by urgency.
3. **Open a warehouse** → see boxes sorted by earliest expiry.
4. **Open a box** → see items color-coded by expiry.
5. **Scan a barcode** — use the Scan tab or the QR button on a box. The scanner recognizes any EAN-13 code (e.g., from a can in your kitchen).
6. **Add an item manually** — box detail → Add items → Manual entry.
7. **Share a warehouse** — warehouse Settings → Invite → generates a link.
8. **P2P sync** — Settings → P2P Sync → Start searching. Requires two devices to test.
9. **Print QR label** — box detail → Print QR → requires a Brother Bluetooth printer to test.

## Permissions and why

- **Camera** — Required to scan box QR codes and product barcodes, and to take item photos.
- **Photo Library** — Required to attach photos from library or save item photos.
- **Bluetooth** — Required to print QR labels on Brother printers AND for P2P sync with another iPhone.
- **Local Network** — Required to discover Brother printer on WiFi AND for P2P sync Bonjour discovery.
- **Notifications** — Optional. Used only for local expiry reminders, scheduled on-device. No remote push.

All permissions are lazy (prompted at point of use), not requested on launch.

## Third-party services

- **Apple** (Sign in with Apple)
- **Supabase** (backend database + image storage, hosted in Ireland, EEA)
- **Open Food Facts** (public barcode lookup, France — no user data sent, only barcode number)
- **Anthropic** (optional AI product recognition, USA — only if user enters their own API key; feature is disabled by default)

No third-party analytics, ads, or tracking SDKs.

---

## AI feature (BYOK — bring your own key)

The AI-assisted product recognition feature is **disabled by default**. It activates only when the user adds their own Anthropic API key in Settings → AI. This is explained in-app and on the Privacy Policy page.

To test the AI feature, the reviewer can either:

1. Skip it (feature is fully optional and the app works without it), or
2. Obtain a free-tier Anthropic API key from https://console.anthropic.com and paste it in Settings → AI. Typical cost per scan is fractional cents.

## Paid app notes

- Kalta is priced at Tier 3 (~$2.99 USD) with Apple Small Business Program enabled.
- Apple Family Sharing is enabled — one purchase covers all Family Group members.
- Refunds are handled by Apple via https://reportaproblem.apple.com.

## Known reviewer-facing quirks

- On **first launch**, the app schedules a background sync of cached data; it may display a brief "Syncing…" banner. This is expected.
- **P2P Sync** requires two iPhones. If the reviewer has only one device available, it is safe to skip testing the P2P screen — the screen opens, starts the advertising session, but cannot establish a pair without a second device.
- **Printer** testing requires a physical Brother Bluetooth label printer. Reviewer can open the print screen to verify the UI renders; the "Select printer" flow requires a paired printer to complete.
