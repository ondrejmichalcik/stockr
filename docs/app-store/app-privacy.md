# App Privacy Questionnaire — Expected Answers

Reference for filling in App Store Connect → App Privacy. Answers are based on the data-handling audit of the Kalta codebase.

---

## Section 1: Does your app collect data?

**Yes.**

Rationale: We collect Apple ID email (if shared), display name, user-generated inventory content (items, boxes, photos), and a user identifier. This is stored on our Supabase backend.

---

## Section 2: Data types collected

For each item below, mark as collected and note purpose + whether it's **linked to the user** and whether it's **used to track**.

### Contact Info

- **Purpose:** App Functionality (account authentication and sharing invitations)

*(Note: Apple's Sign In with Apple private relay is supported — in those cases, the email we see is a relay address.)*

#### Name
- **Collected:** Yes (only first time, if the user shares it via Apple Sign In)

## Section 3: Third-party SDKs

Kalta does not use any third-party advertising or analytics SDKs.

**Apple frameworks used** (not treated as third-party by Apple): AuthenticationServices (Sign in with Apple), MultipeerConnectivity, CoreBluetooth, UserNotifications.

**Third-party libraries** (open-source, no data collection by the library itself):
- Supabase JS client — talks to our own Supabase project.
- Expo + React Native core modules — no telemetry in production builds.
- Brother Print SDK — local Bluetooth only.

---

## Section 4: "Data Used to Track You" (Apple's definition)

**"Tracking" answer: NO — Kalta does not track users.**

Apple defines "tracking" as linking user/device data to third-party data for targeted ads, sharing with data brokers, etc. Kalta does none of this.

Because the answer to "Used for tracking" is No for every data type, Apple will not require you to implement App Tracking Transparency (ATT) prompt.

---

## Section 5: Optional feature disclosure — Anthropic Vision

The AI feature is **opt-in and BYOK** (user brings their own Anthropic API key). Technically, Apple does not require this to be listed in App Privacy because:

1. Kalta does not transmit data to Anthropic — the user does, using their own API key.
2. The user explicitly configures the feature.

**However**, to be fully transparent to reviewers and users, Anthropic is disclosed in:

- The Privacy Policy (Section 6 — Service Providers)
- The Terms of Service (Section 8 — BYOK AI feature)
- In-app disclosure on the AI settings screen when adding the key

## Summary

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Collects any data? | Yes |
| Uses data to track? | **No** |
| Shows privacy nutrition label? | Yes — "Data Linked to You" only (no "Data Used to Track You") |
| Requires ATT prompt? | **No** |

**Privacy Nutrition Label preview:**

```
Data Linked to You
┌──────────────────────┐
│  Contact Info        │ (email, name)
│  User Content        │ (photos, other)
│  Identifiers         │ (user ID)
└──────────────────────┘

Data Not Linked to You: none
Data Used to Track You: none
```

This is one of the friendliest nutrition labels possible for an app that has any backend — use it in marketing copy ("Zero tracking. Data linked only for sharing, nothing else.").
